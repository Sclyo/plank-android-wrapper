Plank Form Evaluation Specifications.
This app is running in a mobile phone browser based on mediapipe pose model and must become a virtual coach for plank form. So it talks when in coaching mode and also in setup mode. 
The sequence is startup screen (1) setup screen (2) COACHING SCREEN (3) Results screen
(1)	Portrait
(2)	Landscape
(3)	Landscape
(4)	Portrait
Setup mode (displayed in landscape mode)
Check if distance is good enough for the model to function properly (2 to 3 meters), detect the plank type (high or elbow) check if the full body is visible if these three conditions are respected, move to coaching mode. 
Screen workflow: 1-2-3-4. 
1: click on start session sends on screen 2 (setup mode)
2: the 3 setup  conditions (good distance are respected sends on screen 3 (coaching screen/ coaching) a start coaching button also exists to force passage to coaching screen
3: user clicks stop or says stop. User is sent to result screen (4) for score/feedback
. Body Alignment Analysis
Target: Perfect straight line from shoulders to ankles
•	Measurement: Shoulder-Hip-Ankle angle using 2D coordinates
•	Target angle: 180° (perfectly straight)
•	Tolerance: ±15° (165° to 195°)
•	Scoring:
o	100 points: Within tolerance (165°-195°)
o	Progressive penalty: 3 points per degree outside tolerance
o	0 points: When landmarks not visible (visibility < 0.3)
Feedback Messages:
•	"Raise your hips" (angle < 170°)
•	"Lower your hips" (angle > 190°)
•	"Can't see your body clearly. Try better lighting." (low visibility)
. Knee Position Analysis
Target: Straight legs with no sagging
•	Measurement: Hip-Knee-Ankle angle
•	Target angle: ≥170° (nearly straight legs)
•	Scoring:
o	100 points: Angle ≥170°
o	Progressive penalty: 2 points per degree below 170°
o	0 points: When leg landmarks not visible
Feedback Messages:
•	"Straighten your legs" (angle < 170°)
•	"Can't see your legs clearly. Adjust position." (low visibility)
. Shoulder Stack Analysis
Target: Proper joint alignment based on plank type
•	High Plank: Shoulders directly over wrists
•	Low Plank: Shoulders directly over elbows
•	Measurement: Horizontal offset between shoulder and target joint (wrist for high plank [meaning extended arms] and elbow for elbow plank. Target is that shoulder point and (elbow or wrist point) form a 90º with the floor.
•	Tolerance: ±10° (70° to 110°)
•	Scoring System:
o	100 points: Offset < 0.2 (excellent alignment)
o	80 points: Offset 0.2-0.3 (good alignment)
o	60 points: Offset > 0.3 (poor alignment)
o	50 points: Partial visibility (fallback score)
Feedback Messages:
•	"Keep hands under shoulders" (high plank misalignment)
•	"Keep elbows under shoulders" (low plank misalignment)
. Technical Implementation Details
Pose Detection:
•	Library: MediaPipe Pose with 33 landmark points
•	Confidence threshold: 0.3 minimum visibility
•	Side selection: Automatically chooses better-visible side
•	Coordinate system: 2D screen coordinates for reliability
Adaptive Scoring:
•	Visibility handling: Graceful degradation when landmarks partially visible
•	Lenient thresholds: Accommodates natural human variation
•	Real-time updates: 30fps analysis during workout
Key Landmarks Used: 
•	Shoulders: Points 11, 12
•	Elbows: Points 13, 14
•	Wrists: Points 15, 16
•	Hips: Points 23, 24
•	Knees: Points 25, 26
•	Ankles: Points 27, 28
. Form Recommendations Engine
•	Dynamic feedback: Changes based on detected issues
•	Priority system: Most critical issues shown first
•	Voice announcements: Key feedback spoken aloud
•	Visual indicators: Color-coded status for each metric

. Overall Scoring System
•	Total Score: Average of three key metrics (0-100 scale)
•	Real-time feedback: Continuous scoring during workout
•	Threshold-based status: Green (90+), Yellow (70-89), Red (<70)

This system provides comprehensive real-time analysis that guides users toward proper plank form while being forgiving enough to work with varying lighting conditions and camera angles.
